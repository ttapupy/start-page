### I'm just trying to get familiar with Next.js and tailwindcss in this project.

In the application itself someone can display a set of hourly updated items from preselected feed sources (RSS/Podcast/Atom).

It can function as a kind of homepage in the browser.

The main concept is to taking advantage of the new feature of [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) in the app/page.tsx file.

Customization is minimal, I tried to parse feeds as safely as possible and display them in a clean layout.
A visitor can reduce selected feed sources which decision then will be saved to a cookie.
