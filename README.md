### I'm just trying to get familiar with Next.js and Tailwind CSS in this project.

In the application itself someone can display a set of hourly updated items from preselected and custom feed sources (RSS/Podcast/Atom).
It can function as a kind of homepage in the browser.

A basic cpncept was to taking advantage of [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) .
Customization is minimal, I tried to parse feeds as safely as possible and display them in a clean layout.
A visitor can select visible feed sources which decision then will be saved to a cookie.
